# ConcreteView
  
  This project was created as part of a bigger project that was never implemented for some reasons. The purpose of the bigger project was to calculate the desired dimensions of the beam and the desired amount of reinforcement and show the result to the user.

 After completing the previous project (JavaGraphics) in order to understand the fundamentals of computer graphics i downloaded an app called "OpenGL ES Examples" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learnopengles.android&hl=el) and started to work on my project. Using algorithms from the above examples the only thing i had to do was to understand the logic and change what i want. So, after hours of reading and trying to understand OpenGL pipeline i created my model. My model consists of two parts, steel and concrete. Concrete model is just a cuboid that is transparent. Steel model has two parts, the cylinders that goes through the length and the extended torus (i made in JavaGraphics project) enclosing the cylinders. I also added some textures that i found online to make it look real. 
 
 By touching the screen you can rotate the object and you can adjust the distance from the SeekBar. Changing from orthographic to perspective projection is achieved by clicking the button. 
  
  It is my first project for Android and except OpenGL ES i also learned programming for Android.
